# Blackjack game

## Rules of the game:

To start the game you need to click the "New Game" button. If you need more cards, click on the "More Cards" button. When there are enough cards, select "Enoughght cards", after which the bank draws cards for yourself.

The one who scores the most points wins, but not exceeding 21 points.
